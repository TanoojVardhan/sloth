# Calendar Components

This folder contains all components related to the calendar page and its features.

- `month-calendar.tsx`: The main monthly calendar grid UI.
- `add-event-dialog.tsx`: Dialog/modal for adding a note/event to a day.

These are used by the `/calendar` page (`app/calendar/page.tsx`).

All calendar logic and UI should be placed here for clarity and maintainability.
